# Termux-Games
<strong>Play Games on Termux</strong> 🎮<br>

<br>
<b>Termux game is a Script where you can find all The Games that Are available for Termux. I have included All the games that are available in Termux Repository. I have also included some games that are on GitHub or written in other languages other than bash like Hangman and 2048. This Script is not complete yet, I am still working on it so I will add more games in the Future.</b>
